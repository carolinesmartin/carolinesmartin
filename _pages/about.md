I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Brandeis University, currently working with Prof. Hannah Yevick. 

My research focuses on soft matter physics- the squishy, messy physics that exists in intermediate length and temperature scales. I'm interested in understanding self-assembly, which is a process where small subunits can spontaneously put themselves together into some larger organized structure. Self-assembly occurs in all sorts of synthetic and biological systems, and gives rise to much of the structure we see around us every day. 

Currently, I'm studying the formation of large, multinuclear syncytia, like the structure that protects the mother-fetal barrier in the placenta. This biomaterial is formed when many cells merge together, a process I'm trying to understand from a mechanical perspective. 

My previous research during my graduate studies at Harvard University with Prof. Vinothan Manoharan focused on a different soft, microscopic system: colloidal suspensions. At Harvard, I developed methods to improve the characterization and tracking of colloidal spheres with an imaging technique called holographic microscopy. I investigated how to use these improved techniques to unravel the dynamics of freely interacting spheres and to precisely infer the forces between them. 

My past and current work have common themes of understanding and modeling the assembly of microscopic materials, both synthetic and living; of tracking particles in 3D space; and of extracting physical information from complex dynamics.

### Mechanics of cell mergers in the human placenta
I'm currently working in the Yevick lab to understand the mechanobiology of the formation of syncytiotrophoblasts, which are huge multinuclear cells that protect the fetal-mother barrier during pregnancy. Through physical perturbation of model cell systems and statistical analysis of cell merger events, I hope to develop a physical model to better understand the formation and failure of these biomaterials

### Precision measurements of colloidal forces
I worked to improve methods to track colloidal spheres in 3D space and applied those methods to infer forces between colloidal spheres. I improved data analysis techniques for extracting information with an imaging technique called holographic microscopy, allowing me to resolve the motion of colloidal spheres to nanometer-scale precision. I used these precise particle trajectories to extract physical information such as the underlying particle pair potential between the spheres.

### Inferring interactions from stochastic trajectories
In collaboration with members of Michael Brenner's group, including Ella King and Megan Engal, I helped to develop a framework for understanding bulk particle interactions by analyzing the two-dimensional trajectories. Using machine learning, we inferred the underlying particle pair potential from experimental videos of many interacting particles.

### Improving particle characterization with holographic microscopy
I've also worked on developing better tools to watch and characterize colloids with light scattering methods like holographic microscopy and dynamic light scattering. I worked to improve characterization and tracking of colloidal particles using holographic microscopy by including optical effects in generative models, and to characterize the effects of spherical aberrations on holography through experiment and simulation.
