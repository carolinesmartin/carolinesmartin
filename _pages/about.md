I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Brandeis University.


Research Interests
======
My research focuses on soft matter physics- the squishy, messy physics that exists in intermediate length and temperature scales. Specifically, I study self-assembly, which is a process where small subunits can spontaneously put themselves together into some larger organized structure. I work to understand and control the self-assembly of colloidal particles, and to build better tools to image and characterize these processes.
