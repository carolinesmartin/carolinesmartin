One side project that I'm most passionate about is an educational platform I've co-founded called A World of Women in STEM ([wowstem.org](http://wowstem.org "WOW STEM")). WOW STEM is an online space for curious young girls to get inspired by other women+ scientists, both historic and modern. By increasing the visibility of women and gender minorities in STEM, I hope to enable young students to imagine themselves as scientists and encourage their curiosity about the world around them. 

I'm lead writer for WOW STEM, but I also edit video scripts, write and research blog posts, and sometimes even star in the content we're making. If you're curious, I think a great place to start is this article I wrote on [Arianna Wright Rosenbluth](https://www.wowstem.org/post/arianna-wright-rosenbluth "Arianna Wright Rosenbluth). I hope you explore our website, and follow our social media pages to learn more about the amazing women+ who have contributed to STEM research throughout history!
